nmon_to_html.py
A small script to convert nmon log files to html using nmonchart developed by Nigel Griffiths.
When converted a small python html-server is started on http://localhost:8000 to see the output on a webbrowser.
Change the settings to point to where your binaries and nmon-log files are.
