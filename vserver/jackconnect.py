"""Create a JACK client that copies input audio directly to the outputs.

This is somewhat modeled after the "thru_client.c" example of JACK 2:
http://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/master/example-clients/thru_client.c

If you have a microphone and loudspeakers connected, this might cause an
acoustical feedback!
